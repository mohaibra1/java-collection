# Java-Collection

ArrayList -> Can contain Duplicates; Maintains the insertion order; Can randomly accessed
LinkedList -> Linked on both ends; Cant contain duplicates; Maninpulation is fast since no shifting required
Vector -> Similar to ArrayList but synchronized and has many methods than ArrayList
Stack -> Lifo(last in fast out)

PriorityQueue -> Fifo; Doesnt allow null elements
ArrayDueue -> Double end operation; Faster than ArrayList and Stack

HashSet -> contains unique elements; Allows at most one null value; Hashing is used to store the elements
TreeSet -> Unique elements; Sorted in ascending order; TreeSet is quite fast
